A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed 
on array , then the array would become . Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. 
Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Explanation

When we perform d = 4 left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
[1,2,3,4,5] -> [2,3,4,5,1] -> [3,4,5,1,2]-> [4,5,1,2,3] -> [5,1,2,3,4]

public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 int[] a = new int[] { 1,2,3,4,5};
		int d = 4;
		int[] result = rotLeft(a, d);
		for(int n : result) {
    System.out.print(n + " ");
            }
	public int[] rotLeft(int[] a, int d) {
		 int[] ret = new int[a.length];
		    for(int i = 0; i < a.length; ++i) {
		        ret[i] = a[(i +d) % a.length];
		    }
		return ret;
	}
  }
